             since empirical potentials are not able to reproduce well the
             properties of both a semiconducting solid and metallic liquid. On the
             other hand, nucleation is a rare event that occurs in much longer
             timescales than those achievable by ab{~}initio molecular dynamics. To
             address this problem, we train a deep neural network potential based
             on a set of data generated by metadynamics simulations using a
             classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect
             all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to
             efficiently drive the crystallization process, we introduce a new
             collective variable based on the Debye structure factor. We are able
             to encode the long-range order information in a local variable which
             is better suited to describe the nucleation dynamics. The reference
             energies are then calculated using the strongly constrained and
             appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, which is
             able to get a better description of the bonding complexity of the Si
             phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free energy surface with a

             properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with
             experimental data. In addition, we study the early stages of the

             solution, which conserves the dynamic as well as structural properties
             of the underlying atomistic system. The CG modeling is built upon the
             framework of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The key is to
             determine each term in the GLE by directly linking it to atomistic
             data. In particular, we propose a two-stage Gaussian process-based
             Bayesian optimization method to infer the non-Markovian memory kernel
             from the data of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF).
             Considering that the long-time behaviors of the VACF and memory kernel
             for polymer solutions can exhibit hydrodynamic scaling (algebraic
             decay with time), we further develop an active learning method to
             determine the emergence of hydrodynamic scaling, which can accelerate
             the inference process of the memory kernel. The proposed methods do
             not rely on how the mean force or CG potential in the GLE is
             constructed. Thus, we also compare two methods for constructing the CG
             potential: a deep learning method and the iterative Boltzmann
             inversion method. With the memory kernel and CG potential determined,
             the GLE is mapped onto an extended Markovian process to circumvent the
             expensive cost of directly solving the GLE. The accuracy and
             computational efficiency of the proposed CG modeling are assessed in a
             model star-polymer solution system at three representative
             concentrations. By comparing with the reference atomistic simulation
             results, we demonstrate that the proposed CG modeling can robustly and
             accurately reproduce the dynamic and structural properties of polymers

             learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular
             mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed
             phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM
             interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction
             smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an
             active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test
             the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six
             nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are
             important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes.
             Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test
             its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target
             QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2
             semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital
             orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles
             which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a
             rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The
             comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy
             profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6
             {\r{A}}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits
             from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and
             including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure,
             so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy
             regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different
             reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles
             made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further
             demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D
             free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the
             training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc
             model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up
             almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost
             negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide
             a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation
             QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications
             ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

             Molecular Dynamics (DeePMD) model in this work. The DeePMD model is
             trained to accurately reproduce the statistical properties of the ab
             initio molecular dynamics. The second type does not require high
             accuracy, and a classical force field is used to describe it in an
             efficient way. The third type is used for a smooth transition between
             the first and the second types of regions. By using a force
             interpolation scheme and imposing a thermodynamics force in the
             transition region, we make the DeePMD region embedded in the AMM
             simulated system as if it were embedded in a system that is fully
             described by the accurate potential. A representative example of the
             liquid water system is used to show the feasibility and promise of
             this method.},

             potential to two- and/or three-body contributions. The scheme, called
             the Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a
             carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-
             grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in
             a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The
             resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the
             configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way
             than with the original atomistic model. As an application, we consider
             liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained
             variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at
             the ab initio molecular dynamics level. We find that the two-body,
             three-body, and higher-order oxygen correlation functions produced by
             the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each

             fractionation with a conjugate caps method combined with neural
             networks (NN-GMFCC) is developed for efficient QM calculation of
             protein energy. In the NN-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of a given

             overlapping conjugate caps. In addition, the two-body interaction
             energies of residue pairs are calculated by molecular mechanics (MM).
             With reference to the GMFCC/MM calculation at the
             {\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD/6-31G* level, the overall mean unsigned
             errors of the energy deviations and atomic force root-mean-squared

             the preparation of a training dataset of ab initio trajectories. Here

             NNP, which describes well both structural and dynamical properties of
             liquid silica. In particular, we calculate the pair correlation

             with more accuracy than that for ab initio methods. We find that
             developed NNP allows us to describe the structure of the glassy silica
             with satisfactory accuracy even though no low-temperature
             configurations were included in the training procedure. The results
             obtained open up prospects for simulating structural and dynamical
             properties of liquids and glasses via NNP.},

    annote =   {The possible existence of a metastable liquid-liquid transition (LLT)
             and a corresponding liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled
             liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been
             rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models
             of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for
             several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this
             phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply
             supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional
             theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed
             additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We
             trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio
             potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the
             Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We
             then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal-multibaric
             ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the
             DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of
             an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We
             fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an
             estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results-obtained from
             a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters-are
             strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the
             hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},
