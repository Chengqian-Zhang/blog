             since empirical potentials are not able to reproduce well the
             properties of both a semiconducting solid and metallic liquid. On the
             other hand, nucleation is a rare event that occurs in much longer
             timescales than those achievable by ab{~}initio molecular dynamics. To
             address this problem, we train a deep neural network potential based
             on a set of data generated by metadynamics simulations using a
             classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect
             all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to
             efficiently drive the crystallization process, we introduce a new
             collective variable based on the Debye structure factor. We are able
             to encode the long-range order information in a local variable which
             is better suited to describe the nucleation dynamics. The reference
             energies are then calculated using the strongly constrained and
             appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, which is
             able to get a better description of the bonding complexity of the Si
             phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free energy surface with a

             properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with
             experimental data. In addition, we study the early stages of the

             solution, which conserves the dynamic as well as structural properties
             of the underlying atomistic system. The CG modeling is built upon the
             framework of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The key is to
             determine each term in the GLE by directly linking it to atomistic
             data. In particular, we propose a two-stage Gaussian process-based
             Bayesian optimization method to infer the non-Markovian memory kernel
             from the data of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF).
             Considering that the long-time behaviors of the VACF and memory kernel
             for polymer solutions can exhibit hydrodynamic scaling (algebraic
             decay with time), we further develop an active learning method to
             determine the emergence of hydrodynamic scaling, which can accelerate
             the inference process of the memory kernel. The proposed methods do
             not rely on how the mean force or CG potential in the GLE is
             constructed. Thus, we also compare two methods for constructing the CG
             potential: a deep learning method and the iterative Boltzmann
             inversion method. With the memory kernel and CG potential determined,
             the GLE is mapped onto an extended Markovian process to circumvent the
             expensive cost of directly solving the GLE. The accuracy and
             computational efficiency of the proposed CG modeling are assessed in a
             model star-polymer solution system at three representative
             concentrations. By comparing with the reference atomistic simulation
             results, we demonstrate that the proposed CG modeling can robustly and
             accurately reproduce the dynamic and structural properties of polymers

             learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular
             mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed
             phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM
             interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction
             smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an
             active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test
             the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six
             nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are
             important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes.
             Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test
             its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target
             QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2
             semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital
             orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles
             which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a
             rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The
             comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy
             profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6
             {\r{A}}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits
             from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and
             including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure,
             so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy
             regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different
             reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles
             made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further
             demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D
             free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the
             training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc
             model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up
             almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost
             negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide
             a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation
             QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications
             ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

             initio molecular dynamics. The second type does not require high
             accuracy, and a classical force field is used to describe it in an
             efficient way. The third type is used for a smooth transition between
             the first and the second types of regions. By using a force
             interpolation scheme and imposing a thermodynamics force in the
             transition region, we make the DeePMD region embedded in the AMM
             simulated system as if it were embedded in a system that is fully
             described by the accurate potential. A representative example of the
             liquid water system is used to show the feasibility and promise of
             this method.},

             the Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a
             carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-
             grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in
             a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The
             resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the
             configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way
             than with the original atomistic model. As an application, we consider
             liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained
             variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at
             the ab initio molecular dynamics level. We find that the two-body,
             three-body, and higher-order oxygen correlation functions produced by
             the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each

             fractionation with a conjugate caps method combined with neural
             networks (NN-GMFCC) is developed for efficient QM calculation of
             protein energy. In the NN-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of a given

             precision neural network potential energies of all capped residues and
             overlapping conjugate caps. In addition, the two-body interaction
             energies of residue pairs are calculated by molecular mechanics (MM).
             With reference to the GMFCC/MM calculation at the
             {\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD/6-31G* level, the overall mean unsigned
             errors of the energy deviations and atomic force root-mean-squared

             particle swarm optimization algorithm or genetic algorithm, is needed
             to conduct crystal structure prediction. In recent years, machine
             learning-based interatomic potential energy surface models have been

             employ a previously developed Deep Potential model to predict the
             intermetallic compound of the aluminum-magnesium system, and find six
             meta-stable phases with negative or nearly zero formation energy. In

             the preparation of a training dataset of ab initio trajectories. Here

             NNP, which describes well both structural and dynamical properties of

             and a corresponding liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled
             liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been
             rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models
             of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for
             several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this
             phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply
             supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional
             theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed
             additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We
             trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio
             potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the
             Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We
             then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal-multibaric
             ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the
             DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of
             an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We
             fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an
             estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results-obtained from
             a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters-are
             strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the
             hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

             Conventional theories for interfacial thermal transport were derived
             based on bulk phonon properties of the materials making up the
             interface without explicitly considering the atomistic interfacial
             details, which are found critical to correctly describing thermal
             boundary conductance. Recent theoretical studies predicted the
             existence of localized phonon modes at the interface which can play an
             important role in understanding interfacial thermal transport.
             However, experimental validation is still lacking. Through a
             combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-energy-resolution electron
             energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron
             microscope, we report the experimental observation of localized
             interfacial phonon modes at ~12{\,}THz at a high-quality epitaxial Si-
             Ge interface. These modes are further confirmed using molecular
             dynamics simulations with a high-fidelity neural network interatomic
             potential, which also yield thermal boundary conductance agreeing well
             with that measured in time-domain thermoreflectance experiments.
             Simulations find that the interfacial phonon modes have an obvious
             contribution to the total thermal boundary conductance. Our findings
             significantly contribute to the understanding of interfacial thermal
             transport physics and have impact on engineering thermal boundary
             conductance at interfaces in applications such as electronics thermal
             management and thermoelectric energy conversion.},

             (aka the solvated "hydronium" cation) likely has two limiting forms,
             that of the Eigen cation (H9O4+) and that of the Zundel cation
             (H5O2+). There has been debate over which of these two is the more
             dominant species and/or whether intermediate (or "distorted")
             structures between these two limits are the more realistic
             representation. Spectroscopy experiments have recently provided
             further results regarding the excess proton. These experiments show
             that the hydrated proton has an anisotropy reorientation time scale on
             the order of 1-2 ps. This time scale has been suggested to possibly
             contradict the picture of the more rapid "special pair dance"
             phenomenon for the hydrated excess proton, which is a signature of a
             distorted Eigen cation. The special pair dance was predicted from
             prior computational studies in which the hydrated central core
             hydronium structure continually switches
             (O-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O)*
             special pair hydrogen-bond partners with the closest three water
             molecules, yielding on average a distorted Eigen cation with three
             equivalent and dynamically exchanging distortions. Through state-of-
             art simulations it is shown here that anisotropy reorientation time
             scales of the same magnitude are obtained that also include structural

             The new method is validated by comparing the DNN moments with those
             generated by ab initio simulations. The moments are used to compute
             the electrostatic potential at the center of a molecular-sized
             hydrophobic cavity in water. The results show that the fields produced

             neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic
             environments are capable of describing some properties of liquid-vapor
             interfaces but typically fail for properties that depend on unbalanced
             long-ranged interactions that build up in the presence of broken
             translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the
             translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network
             potentials to describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating
             explicit models of the slowly varying long-ranged interactions and
             training neural networks only on the short-ranged components, we can
             arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We
             find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a
             local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated
             interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn.
             Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier
             to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in
             a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid, where the exact long-
             ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model, where it

             ability to provide good predictions of water properties by employing a
             strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional has
             been extensively demonstrated in recent years. Here, we further
             advance the modeling of water by building a more accurate model on the
             fourth rung of Jacob's ladder with the hybrid functional, SCAN0. In
             particular, we carry out both classical and Feynman path-integral
             molecular dynamics calculations of water with the SCAN0 functional and
             the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. To generate the equilibrated
             structure of water, a deep neural network potential is trained from
             the atomic potential energy surface based on ab initio data obtained
             from SCAN0 DFT calculations. For the electronic properties of water, a
             separate deep neural network potential is trained by using the Deep
             Wannier method based on the maximally localized Wannier functions of
             the equilibrated trajectory at the SCAN0 level. The structural,
             dynamic, and electric properties of water were analyzed. The hydrogen-
             bond structures, density, infrared spectra, diffusion coefficients,
             and dielectric constants of water, in the electronic ground state, are
             computed by using a large simulation box and long simulation time. For
             the properties involving electronic excitations, we apply the GW
             approximation within many-body perturbation theory to calculate the
             quasiparticle density of states and bandgap of water. Compared to the
             SCAN functional, mixing exact exchange mitigates the self-interaction
             error in the meta-generalized-gradient approximation and further
             softens liquid water toward the experimental direction. For most of
             the water properties, the SCAN0 functional shows a systematic
             improvement over the SCAN functional. However, some important
             discrepancies remain. The H-bond network predicted by the SCAN0
             functional is still slightly overstructured compared to the
             experimental results.},

             necessary to perform simulations at the ab initio level, including
             quantum mechanical effects both for electrons and nuclei. This comes
             at a high computational cost, given that the structural and dynamical
             properties tend to require long timescales and large simulation cells.
             In this work, we evaluate the errors that density functional theory
             (DFT)-based simulations routinely incur into due time- and size-scale
             limitations. These errors are evaluated using neural-network-trained
             force fields that are accurate at the level of DFT methods. We compare

We extracted datasets from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations and used these to train and validate the DPs. Large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations were performed over a wider range of temperatures than AIMD to confirm the reliability and generality of the DPs. We demonstrated that the generated DPs can serve as a powerful tool for simulating alkali chlorides; the DPs also provide results with accuracy that is comparable to that of AIMD and efficiency that is similar to that of empirical potentials. The partial radial distribution functions and angle distribution functions predicted using the DPs are in close agreement with those derived from AIMD. The estimated densities, self-diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and electrical conductivities also matched well with the AIMD and experimental data. This work provides confidence that DPs can be used to explore other systems, including mixtures of chlorides or entirely different salts.}

Firstly, a deep learning potential for Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-B diboride system was fitted with its prediction error in energy and force respectively being 9.2 meV/atom and 208 meV/Å, in comparison with first-principles calculations. Then, temperature dependent lattice constants, anisotropic thermal expansions, anisotropic phonon thermal conductivities, and elastic properties of high entropy (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 from 0 °C to 2400 °C were evaluated, where the predicted room temperature values agree well with experimental measurements. In addition, intrinsic lattice distortions of (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 were analyzed by displacements of atoms from their ideal positions, which are in an order of 10-3 Å and one order of magnitude smaller than those in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C. It indicates that lattice distortions in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 is not so severe as expected.

             initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). However,
             neither large-scale nor long-time calculations are feasible in the
             framework of the ab initio method, which makes it challenging to
             accurately predict some properties. To address this issue, a scheme
             based on ab initio calculation, deep neural networks, and machine
             learning is introduced. By training on high-quality data sets
             generated by ab initio calculations, a deep potential (DP) is
             constructed to describe the interaction between atoms. This work shows
             that the DP enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to
             DFT. By performing molecular dynamics simulations with DP, the
             microstructure and thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic
             (32:68 mol %) are investigated. The structural evolution with
             temperature is analyzed through partial radial distribution functions,
             coordination numbers, angular distribution functions, and structural
             factors. Meanwhile, the estimated thermophysical properties are
             discussed, including density, thermal expansion coefficient, shear
             viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and specific heat capacity. It
             reveals that the Mg2+ ions in this system have a distorted tetrahedral
             geometry rather than an octahedral one (with vacancies). The
             microstructure of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic shows the feature of medium-
             range order, and this feature will be enhanced at a higher
             temperature. All predicted thermophysical properties are in good
             agreement with the experimental results. The hydrodynamic radius
             determined from the shear viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient
             shows that the Mg2+ ions have a strong local structure and diffuse as
             if with an intact coordination shell. Overall, this work provides a
             thorough understanding of the microstructure and enriches the data of
             the thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic.},

             management in any realistic device, the microscopic mechanisms of heat
             transport in all-solid-state electrolytes are poorly known: existing
             calculations, all based on simplistic semi-empirical models, are
             unreliable for superionic conductors and largely overestimate their
             thermal conductivity. In this work, we deploy a combination of state-
             of-the-art methods to calculate the thermal conductivity of a
             prototypical Li-ion conductor, the Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>ClO
             antiperovskite. By leveraging ab initio, machine learning, and force-

             massive role of anharmonic interactions and diffusive defects on the
             thermal conductivity and its temperature dependence, and to eventually
             embed their effects into a simple rationale which is likely applicable
             to a wide class of ionic conductors.</jats:p>},

    abstract = {Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) exhibit a unique combination of excellent properties, including ultra-high melting point, excellent chemical stability, and good oxidation resistance, which make them promising candidates for aerospace and nuclear applications. However, the degradation of high-temperature strength is one of the main limitations for their ultra-high temperature applications. Thus, searching for mechanisms that can help to develop high-performance UHTCs with good high-temperature mechanical properties is urgently needed. To achieve this goal, grain boundary segregation of a series of carbides, including conventional, medium entropy, and high entropy transition metal carbides, i.e., Zr0.95W0.05C, TiZrHfC3, ZrHfNbTaC4, TiZrHfNbTaC5, were studied by atomistic simulations with a fitted Deep Potential (DP), and the effects of segregation on grain boundary strength were emphasized. For all the studied carbides, grain boundary segregations are realized, which are dominated by the atomic size effect. In addition, tensile simulations indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) will usually be strengthened due to segregation. Our simulation results reveal that grain boundary segregation may be a universal mechanism in enhancing the high-temperature strength of both conventional UHTCs and medium/high entropy UHTCs, since GBs play a key role in controlling the fracture of UHTCs at elevated temperatures.}

             theory possible at a cost only moderately higher than that of
             empirical force fields. However, the majority of these models lack
             explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that
             derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this
             limitation, we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range
             electrostatic interaction between ions (nuclei + core electrons) and
             valence electrons with that of distributions of spherical Gaussian
             charges located at ionic and electronic sites. The latter are
             rigorously defined in terms of the centers of the maximally localized
             Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local atomic
             environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the DP
             long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian
             charge system is added to short-range interactions that are
             represented as in the standard DP model. The resulting potential
             energy surface is smooth and possesses analytical forces and virial.
             Missing effects in the standard DP scheme are recovered, improving on
             accuracy and predictive power. By including long-range electrostatics,
             DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the potential energy
             surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on smaller
             systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples: the potential
             energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a
             water molecule with a liquid water slab, and the phonon dispersion

             four-phonon scattering and diffusion transport in two-dimensional (2D)
             thermoelectric materials using the paraelectric phase of 2D SnSe as an
             example. The inherent soft phonon modes are treated by the self-
             consistent phonon theory, which considers the temperature-induced
             renormalization of the phonons. Based on density functional theory and
             the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, we show that the
             four-phonon interactions can reduce the thermal conductivity of the 2D
             SnSe sheet by nearly 40% due to the collapse of soft optical modes,
             and the contribution of diffusion transport to the total thermal
             conductivity accounts for 14% at a high temperature of 800 K due to
             the short phonon mean free path approaching the Ioffe-Regel limit,

             understanding the physical process of protein folding, with important
             implications for protein design and drug discovery. Molecular dynamics
             simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy
             to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are
             inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine
             learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field
             (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level
             of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by
             incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep
             neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations
             from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid
             density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is
             suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the
             selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based
             double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF
             achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of
             0.0039{~}kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of
             2.57{~}$\mathrm{kcal}/\mathrm{mol}/{\AA}$ for force, and it is more
             than 30{~}000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency
             benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF
             provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein
             dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding
             simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge
             acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable

             nanostructured Ag{\textendash}Au, such as Ag{\textendash}Au
             nanoparticles and nanopillars, has been under intense investigation.
             To achieve high accuracy in molecular simulations of Ag{\textendash}Au
             nanoalloys, the surface properties must be modeled with first-
             principles precision. In this work, we constructed a generalizable
             machine learning interatomic potential for Ag{\textendash}Au
             nanoalloys based on deep neural networks trained from a database
             constructed with first-principles calculations. This potential is
             highlighted by the accurate prediction of Au (111) surface
             reconstruction and the segregation of Au toward the Ag{\textendash}Au
             nanoalloy surface, where the empirical force field (EFF) failed in
             both cases. Moreover, regarding the adsorption and diffusion of
             adatoms on surfaces, the overall performance of our potential is
             better than the EFFs. We stress that the reported surface properties
             are blind to the potential modeling in the sense that none of the
             surface configurations is explicitly included in the training
             database; therefore, the reported potential is expected to have a
             strong generalization ability to a wide range of properties and to
             play a key role in investigating nanostructured Ag{\textendash}Au
