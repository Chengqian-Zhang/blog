The slogan for OpenLAM is "Conquer the Periodic Table!" We hope to provide a new infrastructure for microscale scientific research and drive the transformation of microscale industrial design in fields such as materials, energy, and biopharmaceuticals by establishing an open-source ecosystem around large microscale models. Relevant models, data, and workflows will be consolidated around the AIS Square; related software development will take place in the DeepModeling open-source community. At the same time, we welcome open interaction from different communities in model development, data sharing, evaluation, and testing.

See [AIS Square](https://www.aissquare.com/openlam) for more details.

## Model Structure

- The DPA-2 model structure (PyTorch based) has been released, showing a significant increase in fitting and transferability compared to the DPA-1 ([arxiv:2312.15492](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15492)).
- A new capability for unsupervised denoise pretraining has been added ([DOI:10.5281/zenodo.10483908](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10483908)).
