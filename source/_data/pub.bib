             since empirical potentials are not able to reproduce well the
             properties of both a semiconducting solid and metallic liquid. On the
             other hand, nucleation is a rare event that occurs in much longer
             timescales than those achievable by ab{~}initio molecular dynamics. To
             address this problem, we train a deep neural network potential based
             on a set of data generated by metadynamics simulations using a
             classical potential. We show how this is an effective way to collect
             all the relevant data for the process of interest. In order to
             efficiently drive the crystallization process, we introduce a new
             collective variable based on the Debye structure factor. We are able
             to encode the long-range order information in a local variable which
             is better suited to describe the nucleation dynamics. The reference
             energies are then calculated using the strongly constrained and
             appropriately normed (SCAN) exchange-correlation functional, which is
             able to get a better description of the bonding complexity of the Si
             phase diagram. Finally, we recover the free energy surface with a

             properties near the melting point, obtaining a good agreement with
             experimental data. In addition, we study the early stages of the

             solution, which conserves the dynamic as well as structural properties
             of the underlying atomistic system. The CG modeling is built upon the
             framework of the generalized Langevin equation (GLE). The key is to
             determine each term in the GLE by directly linking it to atomistic
             data. In particular, we propose a two-stage Gaussian process-based
             Bayesian optimization method to infer the non-Markovian memory kernel
             from the data of the velocity autocorrelation function (VACF).
             Considering that the long-time behaviors of the VACF and memory kernel
             for polymer solutions can exhibit hydrodynamic scaling (algebraic
             decay with time), we further develop an active learning method to
             determine the emergence of hydrodynamic scaling, which can accelerate
             the inference process of the memory kernel. The proposed methods do
             not rely on how the mean force or CG potential in the GLE is
             constructed. Thus, we also compare two methods for constructing the CG
             potential: a deep learning method and the iterative Boltzmann
             inversion method. With the memory kernel and CG potential determined,
             the GLE is mapped onto an extended Markovian process to circumvent the
             expensive cost of directly solving the GLE. The accuracy and
             computational efficiency of the proposed CG modeling are assessed in a
             model star-polymer solution system at three representative
             concentrations. By comparing with the reference atomistic simulation
             results, we demonstrate that the proposed CG modeling can robustly and
             accurately reproduce the dynamic and structural properties of polymers

             learning potential for combined quantum mechanical/molecular
             mechanical (QM/MM) simulations of chemical reactions in the condensed
             phase. The new range correction enables short-ranged QM/MM
             interactions to be tuned for higher accuracy, and the correction
             smoothly vanishes within a specified cutoff. We further develop an
             active learning procedure for robust neural network training. We test
             the DPRc model and training procedure against a series of six
             nonenzymatic phosphoryl transfer reactions in solution that are
             important in mechanistic studies of RNA-cleaving enzymes.
             Specifically, we apply DPRc corrections to a base QM model and test
             its ability to reproduce free-energy profiles generated from a target
             QM model. We perform these comparisons using the MNDO/d and DFTB2
             semiempirical models because they differ in the way they treat orbital
             orthogonalization and electrostatics and produce free-energy profiles
             which differ significantly from each other, thereby providing us a
             rigorous stress test for the DPRc model and training procedure. The
             comparisons show that accurate reproduction of the free-energy
             profiles requires correction of the QM/MM interactions out to 6
             {\r{A}}. We further find that the model's initial training benefits
             from generating data from temperature replica exchange simulations and
             including high-temperature configurations into the fitting procedure,
             so the resulting models are trained to properly avoid high-energy
             regions. A single DPRc model was trained to reproduce four different
             reactions and yielded good agreement with the free-energy profiles
             made from the target QM/MM simulations. The DPRc model was further
             demonstrated to be transferable to 2D free-energy surfaces and 1D
             free-energy profiles that were not explicitly considered in the
             training. Examination of the computational performance of the DPRc
             model showed that it was fairly slow when run on CPUs but was sped up
             almost 100-fold when using NVIDIA V100 GPUs, resulting in almost
             negligible overhead. The new DPRc model and training procedure provide
             a potentially powerful new tool for the creation of next-generation
             QM/MM potentials for a wide spectrum of free-energy applications
             ranging from drug discovery to enzyme design.},

             trained to accurately reproduce the statistical properties of the ab
             initio molecular dynamics. The second type does not require high
             accuracy, and a classical force field is used to describe it in an
             efficient way. The third type is used for a smooth transition between
             the first and the second types of regions. By using a force
             interpolation scheme and imposing a thermodynamics force in the
             transition region, we make the DeePMD region embedded in the AMM
             simulated system as if it were embedded in a system that is fully
             described by the accurate potential. A representative example of the
             liquid water system is used to show the feasibility and promise of
             this method.},

             potential to two- and/or three-body contributions. The scheme, called
             the Deep Coarse-Grained Potential (abbreviated DeePCG), exploits a
             carefully crafted neural network to construct a many-body coarse-
             grained potential. The network is trained with full atomistic data in
             a way that preserves the natural symmetries of the system. The
             resulting model is very accurate and can be used to sample the
             configurations of the coarse-grained variables in a much faster way
             than with the original atomistic model. As an application, we consider
             liquid water and use the oxygen coordinates as the coarse-grained
             variables, starting from a full atomistic simulation of this system at
             the ab initio molecular dynamics level. We find that the two-body,
             three-body, and higher-order oxygen correlation functions produced by
             the coarse-grained and full atomistic models agree very well with each

             fractionation with a conjugate caps method combined with neural
             networks (NN-GMFCC) is developed for efficient QM calculation of
             protein energy. In the NN-GMFCC scheme, the total energy of a given

             overlapping conjugate caps. In addition, the two-body interaction
             energies of residue pairs are calculated by molecular mechanics (MM).
             With reference to the GMFCC/MM calculation at the
             {\ensuremath{\omega}}B97XD/6-31G* level, the overall mean unsigned
             errors of the energy deviations and atomic force root-mean-squared

             particle swarm optimization algorithm or genetic algorithm, is needed
             to conduct crystal structure prediction. In recent years, machine
             learning-based interatomic potential energy surface models have been

             prediction for systems with the accuracy of density functional theory
             (DFT) and the speed of empirical force fields. In this paper, we
             employ a previously developed Deep Potential model to predict the
             intermetallic compound of the aluminum-magnesium system, and find six
             meta-stable phases with negative or nearly zero formation energy. In

             representing the interatomic potential energy surface allows us to
             achieve an optimal balance between accuracy and efficiency in computer
             simulation of materials. A key point in developing such potentials is
             the preparation of a training dataset of ab initio trajectories. Here
             we apply a deep potential molecular dynamics (DeePMD) approach to
             develop NNP for silica, which is the representative glassformer widely
             used as a model system for simulating network-forming liquids and
             glasses. We show that the use of a relatively small training dataset
             of high-temperature ab initio configurations is enough to fabricate
             NNP, which describes well both structural and dynamical properties of
             liquid silica. In particular, we calculate the pair correlation
             functions, angular distribution function, velocity autocorrelation
             functions, vibrational density of states, and mean-square displacement
             and reveal a close agreement with ab initio data. We show that NNP
             allows us to expand significantly the time-space scales achievable in
             simulations and thus calculating dynamical and transport properties
             with more accuracy than that for ab initio methods. We find that
             developed NNP allows us to describe the structure of the glassy silica
             with satisfactory accuracy even though no low-temperature

             and a corresponding liquid-liquid critical point (LLCP) in supercooled
             liquid water remains a topic of much debate. An LLT has been
             rigorously proved in three empirically parametrized molecular models
             of water, and evidence consistent with an LLT has been reported for
             several other such models. In contrast, experimental proof of this
             phenomenon has been elusive due to rapid ice nucleation under deeply
             supercooled conditions. In this work, we combined density functional
             theory (DFT), machine learning, and molecular simulations to shed
             additional light on the possible existence of an LLT in water. We
             trained a deep neural network (DNN) model to represent the ab initio
             potential energy surface of water from DFT calculations using the
             Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) functional. We
             then used advanced sampling simulations in the multithermal-multibaric
             ensemble to efficiently explore the thermophysical properties of the
             DNN model. The simulation results are consistent with the existence of
             an LLCP, although they do not constitute a rigorous proof thereof. We
             fit the simulation data to a two-state equation of state to provide an
             estimate of the LLCP's location. These combined results-obtained from
             a purely first-principles approach with no empirical parameters-are
             strongly suggestive of the existence of an LLT, bolstering the
             hypothesis that water can separate into two distinct liquid forms.},

             Conventional theories for interfacial thermal transport were derived
             based on bulk phonon properties of the materials making up the
             interface without explicitly considering the atomistic interfacial
             details, which are found critical to correctly describing thermal
             boundary conductance. Recent theoretical studies predicted the
             existence of localized phonon modes at the interface which can play an
             important role in understanding interfacial thermal transport.
             However, experimental validation is still lacking. Through a
             combination of Raman spectroscopy and high-energy-resolution electron
             energy-loss spectroscopy in a scanning transmission electron
             microscope, we report the experimental observation of localized
             interfacial phonon modes at ~12{\,}THz at a high-quality epitaxial Si-
             Ge interface. These modes are further confirmed using molecular
             dynamics simulations with a high-fidelity neural network interatomic
             potential, which also yield thermal boundary conductance agreeing well
             with that measured in time-domain thermoreflectance experiments.
             Simulations find that the interfacial phonon modes have an obvious
             contribution to the total thermal boundary conductance. Our findings
             significantly contribute to the understanding of interfacial thermal
             transport physics and have impact on engineering thermal boundary
             conductance at interfaces in applications such as electronics thermal
             management and thermoelectric energy conversion.},

             (aka the solvated "hydronium" cation) likely has two limiting forms,
             that of the Eigen cation (H9O4+) and that of the Zundel cation
             (H5O2+). There has been debate over which of these two is the more
             dominant species and/or whether intermediate (or "distorted")
             structures between these two limits are the more realistic
             representation. Spectroscopy experiments have recently provided
             further results regarding the excess proton. These experiments show
             that the hydrated proton has an anisotropy reorientation time scale on
             the order of 1-2 ps. This time scale has been suggested to possibly
             contradict the picture of the more rapid "special pair dance"
             phenomenon for the hydrated excess proton, which is a signature of a
             distorted Eigen cation. The special pair dance was predicted from
             prior computational studies in which the hydrated central core
             hydronium structure continually switches
             (O-H{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}O)*
             special pair hydrogen-bond partners with the closest three water
             molecules, yielding on average a distorted Eigen cation with three
             equivalent and dynamically exchanging distortions. Through state-of-
             art simulations it is shown here that anisotropy reorientation time

             The new method is validated by comparing the DNN moments with those

             the electrostatic potential at the center of a molecular-sized

             theory, we consider how to train an artificial neural network
             potential to describe inhomogeneous, disordered systems. We find that
             neural network potentials based on local representations of atomic
             environments are capable of describing some properties of liquid-vapor
             interfaces but typically fail for properties that depend on unbalanced
             long-ranged interactions that build up in the presence of broken
             translation symmetry. These same interactions cancel in the
             translationally invariant bulk, allowing local neural network
             potentials to describe bulk properties correctly. By incorporating
             explicit models of the slowly varying long-ranged interactions and
             training neural networks only on the short-ranged components, we can
             arrive at potentials that robustly recover interfacial properties. We
             find that local neural network models can sometimes approximate a
             local molecular field potential to correct for the truncated
             interactions, but this behavior is variable and hard to learn.
             Generally, we find that models with explicit electrostatics are easier
             to train and have higher accuracy. We demonstrate this perspective in
             a simple model of an asymmetric dipolar fluid, where the exact long-
             ranged interaction is known, and in an ab initio water model, where it

             ability to provide good predictions of water properties by employing a
             strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) functional has
             been extensively demonstrated in recent years. Here, we further
             advance the modeling of water by building a more accurate model on the
             fourth rung of Jacob's ladder with the hybrid functional, SCAN0. In
             particular, we carry out both classical and Feynman path-integral
             molecular dynamics calculations of water with the SCAN0 functional and
             the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. To generate the equilibrated
             structure of water, a deep neural network potential is trained from
             the atomic potential energy surface based on ab initio data obtained
             from SCAN0 DFT calculations. For the electronic properties of water, a
             separate deep neural network potential is trained by using the Deep
             Wannier method based on the maximally localized Wannier functions of
             the equilibrated trajectory at the SCAN0 level. The structural,
             dynamic, and electric properties of water were analyzed. The hydrogen-
             bond structures, density, infrared spectra, diffusion coefficients,
             and dielectric constants of water, in the electronic ground state, are
             computed by using a large simulation box and long simulation time. For
             the properties involving electronic excitations, we apply the GW
             approximation within many-body perturbation theory to calculate the
             quasiparticle density of states and bandgap of water. Compared to the
             SCAN functional, mixing exact exchange mitigates the self-interaction
             error in the meta-generalized-gradient approximation and further
             softens liquid water toward the experimental direction. For most of
             the water properties, the SCAN0 functional shows a systematic
             improvement over the SCAN functional. However, some important
             discrepancies remain. The H-bond network predicted by the SCAN0
             functional is still slightly overstructured compared to the
             experimental results.},

             fully understand and reproduce its complex phase diagram, it is
             necessary to perform simulations at the ab initio level, including
             quantum mechanical effects both for electrons and nuclei. This comes
             at a high computational cost, given that the structural and dynamical
             properties tend to require long timescales and large simulation cells.
             In this work, we evaluate the errors that density functional theory
             (DFT)-based simulations routinely incur into due time- and size-scale
             limitations. These errors are evaluated using neural-network-trained
             force fields that are accurate at the level of DFT methods. We compare

             water that require large timescales. We show that structural

We extracted datasets from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) calculations and used these to train and validate the DPs. Large-scale and long-time molecular dynamics simulations were performed over a wider range of temperatures than AIMD to confirm the reliability and generality of the DPs. We demonstrated that the generated DPs can serve as a powerful tool for simulating alkali chlorides; the DPs also provide results with accuracy that is comparable to that of AIMD and efficiency that is similar to that of empirical potentials. The partial radial distribution functions and angle distribution functions predicted using the DPs are in close agreement with those derived from AIMD. The estimated densities, self-diffusion coefficients, shear viscosities, and electrical conductivities also matched well with the AIMD and experimental data. This work provides confidence that DPs can be used to explore other systems, including mixtures of chlorides or entirely different salts.}

Firstly, a deep learning potential for Ti-Zr-Hf-Nb-Ta-B diboride system was fitted with its prediction error in energy and force respectively being 9.2 meV/atom and 208 meV/Å, in comparison with first-principles calculations. Then, temperature dependent lattice constants, anisotropic thermal expansions, anisotropic phonon thermal conductivities, and elastic properties of high entropy (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 from 0 °C to 2400 °C were evaluated, where the predicted room temperature values agree well with experimental measurements. In addition, intrinsic lattice distortions of (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 were analyzed by displacements of atoms from their ideal positions, which are in an order of 10-3 Å and one order of magnitude smaller than those in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)C. It indicates that lattice distortions in (Ti0.2Zr0.2Hf0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2)B2 is not so severe as expected.

             initio calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). However,
             neither large-scale nor long-time calculations are feasible in the
             framework of the ab initio method, which makes it challenging to
             accurately predict some properties. To address this issue, a scheme
             based on ab initio calculation, deep neural networks, and machine
             learning is introduced. By training on high-quality data sets
             generated by ab initio calculations, a deep potential (DP) is
             constructed to describe the interaction between atoms. This work shows
             that the DP enables higher efficiency and similar accuracy relative to
             DFT. By performing molecular dynamics simulations with DP, the
             microstructure and thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic
             (32:68 mol %) are investigated. The structural evolution with
             temperature is analyzed through partial radial distribution functions,
             coordination numbers, angular distribution functions, and structural
             factors. Meanwhile, the estimated thermophysical properties are
             discussed, including density, thermal expansion coefficient, shear
             viscosity, self-diffusion coefficient, and specific heat capacity. It
             reveals that the Mg2+ ions in this system have a distorted tetrahedral
             geometry rather than an octahedral one (with vacancies). The
             microstructure of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic shows the feature of medium-
             range order, and this feature will be enhanced at a higher
             temperature. All predicted thermophysical properties are in good
             agreement with the experimental results. The hydrodynamic radius
             determined from the shear viscosity and self-diffusion coefficient
             shows that the Mg2+ ions have a strong local structure and diffuse as
             if with an intact coordination shell. Overall, this work provides a
             thorough understanding of the microstructure and enriches the data of
             the thermophysical properties of the MgCl2-KCl eutectic.},

             management in any realistic device, the microscopic mechanisms of heat
             transport in all-solid-state electrolytes are poorly known: existing
             calculations, all based on simplistic semi-empirical models, are
             unreliable for superionic conductors and largely overestimate their
             thermal conductivity. In this work, we deploy a combination of state-
             of-the-art methods to calculate the thermal conductivity of a
             prototypical Li-ion conductor, the Li<jats:sub>3</jats:sub>ClO
             antiperovskite. By leveraging ab initio, machine learning, and force-
             field descriptions of interatomic forces, we are able to reveal the
             massive role of anharmonic interactions and diffusive defects on the
             thermal conductivity and its temperature dependence, and to eventually
             embed their effects into a simple rationale which is likely applicable
             to a wide class of ionic conductors.</jats:p>},

    abstract = {Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) exhibit a unique combination of excellent properties, including ultra-high melting point, excellent chemical stability, and good oxidation resistance, which make them promising candidates for aerospace and nuclear applications. However, the degradation of high-temperature strength is one of the main limitations for their ultra-high temperature applications. Thus, searching for mechanisms that can help to develop high-performance UHTCs with good high-temperature mechanical properties is urgently needed. To achieve this goal, grain boundary segregation of a series of carbides, including conventional, medium entropy, and high entropy transition metal carbides, i.e., Zr0.95W0.05C, TiZrHfC3, ZrHfNbTaC4, TiZrHfNbTaC5, were studied by atomistic simulations with a fitted Deep Potential (DP), and the effects of segregation on grain boundary strength were emphasized. For all the studied carbides, grain boundary segregations are realized, which are dominated by the atomic size effect. In addition, tensile simulations indicate that grain boundaries (GBs) will usually be strengthened due to segregation. Our simulation results reveal that grain boundary segregation may be a universal mechanism in enhancing the high-temperature strength of both conventional UHTCs and medium/high entropy UHTCs, since GBs play a key role in controlling the fracture of UHTCs at elevated temperatures.}

             theory possible at a cost only moderately higher than that of
             empirical force fields. However, the majority of these models lack
             explicit long-range interactions and fail to describe properties that
             derive from the Coulombic tail of the forces. To overcome this
             limitation, we extend the DP model by approximating the long-range
             electrostatic interaction between ions (nuclei + core electrons) and
             valence electrons with that of distributions of spherical Gaussian
             charges located at ionic and electronic sites. The latter are
             rigorously defined in terms of the centers of the maximally localized
             Wannier distributions, whose dependence on the local atomic
             environment is modeled accurately by a deep neural network. In the DP
             long-range (DPLR) model, the electrostatic energy of the Gaussian
             charge system is added to short-range interactions that are
             represented as in the standard DP model. The resulting potential
             energy surface is smooth and possesses analytical forces and virial.
             Missing effects in the standard DP scheme are recovered, improving on
             accuracy and predictive power. By including long-range electrostatics,
             DPLR correctly extrapolates to large systems the potential energy
             surface learned from quantum mechanical calculations on smaller
             systems. We illustrate the approach with three examples: the potential
             energy profile of the water dimer, the free energy of interaction of a
             water molecule with a liquid water slab, and the phonon dispersion

             four-phonon scattering and diffusion transport in two-dimensional (2D)
             thermoelectric materials using the paraelectric phase of 2D SnSe as an
             example. The inherent soft phonon modes are treated by the self-
             consistent phonon theory, which considers the temperature-induced
             renormalization of the phonons. Based on density functional theory and
             the Peierls-Boltzmann transport equation for phonons, we show that the
             four-phonon interactions can reduce the thermal conductivity of the 2D
             SnSe sheet by nearly 40% due to the collapse of soft optical modes,
             and the contribution of diffusion transport to the total thermal
             conductivity accounts for 14% at a high temperature of 800 K due to
             the short phonon mean free path approaching the Ioffe-Regel limit,

             understanding the physical process of protein folding, with important
             implications for protein design and drug discovery. Molecular dynamics
             simulation strongly requires advanced force fields with high accuracy
             to achieve correct folding. However, the current force fields are
             inaccurate, inapplicable and inefficient. We propose a machine
             learning protocol, the inductive transfer learning force field
             (ITLFF), to construct protein force fields in seconds with any level
             of accuracy from a small dataset. This process is achieved by
             incorporating an inductive transfer learning algorithm into deep
             neural networks, which learn knowledge of any high-level calculations
             from a large dataset of low-level method. Here, we use a double-hybrid
             density functional theory (DFT) as a case functional, but ITLFF is
             suitable for any high-precision functional. The performance of the
             selected 18 proteins indicates that compared with the fragment-based
             double-hybrid DFT algorithm, the force field constructed by ITLFF
             achieves considerable accuracy with a mean absolute error of
             0.0039{~}kcal/mol/atom for energy and a root mean square error of
             2.57{~}$\mathrm{kcal}/\mathrm{mol}/{\AA}$ for force, and it is more
             than 30{~}000 times faster and obtains more significant efficiency
             benefits as the system increases. The outstanding performance of ITLFF
             provides promising prospects for accurate and efficient protein
             dynamic simulations and makes an important step toward protein folding
             simulation. Due to the ability of ITLFF to utilize the knowledge
             acquired in one task to solve related problems, it is also applicable

             nanostructured Ag{-}Au, such as Ag{-}Au
             nanoparticles and nanopillars, has been under intense investigation.
             To achieve high accuracy in molecular simulations of Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloys, the surface properties must be modeled with first-
             principles precision. In this work, we constructed a generalizable
             machine learning interatomic potential for Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloys based on deep neural networks trained from a database
             constructed with first-principles calculations. This potential is
             highlighted by the accurate prediction of Au (111) surface
             reconstruction and the segregation of Au toward the Ag{-}Au
             nanoalloy surface, where the empirical force field (EFF) failed in
             both cases. Moreover, regarding the adsorption and diffusion of
             adatoms on surfaces, the overall performance of our potential is
             better than the EFFs. We stress that the reported surface properties
             are blind to the potential modeling in the sense that none of the
             surface configurations is explicitly included in the training
             database; therefore, the reported potential is expected to have a
             strong generalization ability to a wide range of properties and to
             play a key role in investigating nanostructured Ag{-}Au

             and high photoelectric efficiencies. However, the structural
             instability originating from inherent ionic defects leads to a sharp
             drop in the photoelectric efficiency, which significantly limits their
             applications in solar cells. The instability induced by ionic defects
             remains unresolved due to its complicated reaction process. Herein, to
             explore the effects of ionic defects on stability, we develop a deep
             learning potential for a CsPbI3 ternary system based upon density
             functional theory (DFT) calculated data for large-scale molecular
             dynamics (MD) simulations. By exploring 2.4 million configurations, of
             which 7,730 structures are used for the training set, the deep
             learning potential shows an accuracy approaching DFT-level.
             Furthermore, MD simulations with a 5,000-atom system and a one
             nanosecond timeframe are performed to explore the effects of bulk and
             surface defects on the stability of CsPbI3 . This deep learning
             potential based MD simulation provides solid evidence together with
             the derived radial distribution functions, simulated diffraction of
             X-rays, instability temperature, molecular trajectory, and
             coordination number for revealing the instability mechanism of CsPbI3
             . Among bulk defects, Cs defects have the most significant influence
             on the stability of CsPbI3 with a defect tolerance concentration of
             0.32{\,}%, followed by Pb and I defects. With regards to surface
             defects, Cs defects have the largest impact on the stability of CsPbI3
             when the defect concentration is less than 15{\,}%, whereas Pb defects
             act play a dominant role for defect concentrations exceeding 20{\,}%.
             Most importantly, this machine-learning-based MD simulation strategy
             provides a new avenue to explore the ionic defect effects on the
             stability of perovskite-like materials, laying a theoretical
             foundation for the design of stable perovskite materials.},

             The resulting reciprocal-space structure factors agree quantitatively

             accurate ab initio computational techniques preclude their application
             to modeling surface processes occurring on a long time scale, such as
             ALD. Although the situation can be greatly improved using machine

             atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) can be a challenging task if the
             flexibility of the adsorbent needs to be included. This is because
             potentials need to be developed that accurately account for the motion
             of the adsorbent in response to the presence of adsorbate molecules.
             In this work, we show that it is possible to use accurate machine
             learning atomistic potentials for metal-organic frameworks in concert
             with classical potentials for adsorbates to accurately compute
             diffusivities though a hybrid potential approach. As a proof-of-
             concept, we have developed an accurate deep learning potential (DP)
             for UiO-66, a metal-organic framework, and used this DP to perform
             hybrid potential simulations, modeling diffusion of neon and xenon
             through the crystal. The adsorbate-adsorbate interactions were modeled
             with Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials, the adsorbent-adsorbent
             interactions were described by the DP, and the adsorbent-adsorbate
             interactions used LJ cross-interactions. Thus, our hybrid potential
             allows for adsorbent-adsorbate interactions with classical potentials
             but models the response of the adsorbent to the presence of the
             adsorbate through near-DFT accuracy DPs. This hybrid approach does not
             require refitting the DP for new adsorbates. We calculated self-
             diffusion coefficients for Ne in UiO-66 from DFT-MD, our hybrid DP/LJ
             approach, and from two different classical potentials for UiO-66. Our
             DP/LJ results are in excellent agreement with DFT-MD. We modeled
             diffusion of Xe in UiO-66 with DP/LJ and a classical potential.
             Diffusion of Xe in UiO-66 is about a factor of 30 slower than that of
             Ne, so it is not computationally feasible to compute Xe diffusion with
             DFT-MD. Our hybrid DP-classical potential approach can be applied to
             other MOFs and other adsorbates, making it possible to use an accurate
             DP generated from DFT simulations of an empty adsorbent in concert
             with existing classical potentials for adsorbates to model adsorption
             and diffusion within the porous material, including adsorbate-induced
             changes to the framework.},

             configuration-dependent properties of substitutionally disordered
             systems. Typically, a CE model is built by fitting a few tens or
             hundreds of target quantities calculated by first-principles
             approaches. To validate the reliability of the model, a convergence
             test of the cross-validation (CV) score to the training set size is
             commonly conducted to verify the sufficiency of the training data.
             However, such a test only confirms the convergence of the predictive
             capability of the CE model within the training set, and it is unknown
             whether the convergence of the CV score would lead to robust
             thermodynamic simulation results such as order-disorder phase
             transition temperature Tc. In this work, using carbon defective MoC1-x
             as a model system and aided by the machine-learning force field
             technique, a training data pool with about 13000 configurations has

             training set size that is sufficient for the CV score to converge
             still leads to a significant uncertainty in the predicted Tc and that
             the latter can be considerably reduced by enlarging the training set
             to that of a few thousand configurations. This work highlights the

             such that the cluster has equal probabilities of growing or melting at
             the given supersaturation), which is used together with the equations

             ab initio DFT (PBE0/6-31G*) QM/MM energies and forces. The DPRc thus
             enables both QM and QM/MM interactions to be tuned to high accuracy,

             it gradually transforms into a cage-like configuration as the size

             (DFT) at the meta-GGA level and/or with exact exchange, quantum Monte
             Carlo, etc., generating a sufficient amount of data for training an ML
             potential has remained computationally challenging due to their high
             cost. In this work, we demonstrate that this issue can be largely
             alleviated with Deep Kohn-Sham (DeePKS), an ML-based DFT model. DeePKS
             employs a computationally efficient neural network-based functional
             model to construct a correction term added upon a cheap DFT model.
             Upon training, DeePKS offers closely matched energies and forces

             method for estimating the free energy surface of an expensive "high-
             level" potential energy function from the umbrella sampling performed
             with multiple inexpensive "low-level" reference potentials. The gwTP
             method is a generalization of the weighted thermodynamic perturbation
             (wTP) method developed by Li and co-workers [J. Chem. Theory Comput.
             2018, 14, 5583-5596] that uses a single "low-level" reference
             potential. The gwTP method offers new possibilities in model design
             whereby the sampling generated from several low-level potentials may
             be combined (e.g., specific reaction parameter models that might have
             variable accuracy at different stages of a multistep reaction). The
             gwTP method is especially well suited for use with machine learning
             potentials (MLPs) that are trained against computationally expensive
             ab initio quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) energies and
             forces using active learning procedures that naturally produce
             multiple distinct neural network potentials. Simulations can be
             performed with greater sampling using the fast MLPs and then corrected
             to the ab initio level using gwTP. The capabilities of the gwTP method
             are demonstrated by creating reference potentials based on the MNDO/d
             and DFTB2/MIO semiempirical models supplemented with the "range-
             corrected deep potential" (DPRc). The DPRc parameters are trained to
             ab initio QM/MM data, and the potentials are used to calculate the
             free energy surface of stepwise mechanisms for nonenzymatic RNA
             2'-O-transesterification model reactions. The extended sampling made
             possible by the reference potentials allows one to identify
             unequilibrated portions of the simulations that are not always evident
             from the short time scale commonly used with ab initio QM/MM
             potentials. We show that the reference potential approach can yield
             more accurate ab initio free energy predictions than the wTP method or
             what can be reasonably afforded from explicit ab initio QM/MM

             attention has been given to their mechanical properties, even though
             plastic deformation processes in the interiors of planets are known to

             ideal shear strength (ISS) and dislocation behavior. The ISS results
             are well described by the renormalized Frenkel model of ideal strength
             and indicate that the SI ices are expected to be highly ductile. This
             is further supported by deep neural network molecular dynamics
             simulations for the behavior of lattice dislocations for the SI face-

             graphene with molecular vibrations, rendering harmonic phonon heat
             transport being dominant. In contrast, in a spectrally mismatched

             the influence of the slab thickness on water dissociation energy
             (Ediss) at 1 monolayer coverage using static density functional theory
             calculation and found that Ediss exhibits odd-even oscillation with
             respect to the TiO2 slab thickness. However, less studies have
             accounted for the full solvation of an aqueous phase using ab initio
             molecular dynamics due to high computational costs in which only
             three, four, and five trilayer models of rutile(110)-water interfaces
             have been simulated. Here, we report Machine Learning accelerated
             Molecular Dynamics (MLMD) simulations of defect-free rutile(110)-water
             interfaces, which allows for a systematic study of the slab thickness
             ranging from 3 to 17 trilayers with much lower costs while keeping ab
             initio accuracy. Our MLMD simulations show that the dissociation
             degree of surface water ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}) oscillates with the
             slab thickness and converges to {\ensuremath{\sim}}2% as the TiO2 slab
             becomes thicker. Converting {\ensuremath{\alpha}} into dissociation
             free energy ({\ensuremath{\Delta}}Adiss) and comparing with
             dissociation total energy Ediss calculated with a single monolayer of
             water, we find that the full solvation of the interfaces suppresses
             surface water from dissociating. It is interesting to note that the
             machine learning potential trained from the dataset containing
             exclusively the five trilayer TiO2 model exhibits excellent
             transferability to other slab thicknesses and further captures the

             interaction between double trilayers and, thus, the bonding strength
             between terminal Ti and water, which affects pKa of surface water and

             transition from the herringbone pattern to the stripe pattern, and
             both agree well with the experimental observations.},

             devices are widely regarded as detrimental defects that accelerate
             charge and energy losses through nonradiative carrier trapping and
             recombination, but the mechanism is still under debate owing to the
             diversity of GB configurations and behaviors. We combine ab initio
             electronic structure and machine learning force field to investigate
             evolution of the geometric and electronic structure of a CsPbBr3 GB on
             a nanosecond timescale, which is comparable with the carrier
             recombination time. We demonstrate that the GB slides spontaneously
             within a few picoseconds increasing the band gap. Subsequent
             structural oscillations dynamically produce midgap trap states through
             Pb-Pb interactions across the GB. After several hundred picoseconds,
             structural distortions start to occur, increasing the occurrence of
             deep midgap states. We identify a distinct correlation of the average
             Pb-Pb distance and fluctuations in the ion coordination numbers with
             the appearance of the midgap states. Suppressing GB distortions
             through annealing and breaking up Pb-Pb dimers by passivation can
             efficiently alleviate the detrimental effects of GBs in perovskites.
             The study provides new insights into passivation of the detrimental GB
             defects, and demonstrates that structural and charge carrier dynamics

             with the presence of hydroxide (OH-) ion in water are essential for
             understanding their roles in biological and chemical processes but
             have not been fully explored. Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is
             an important tool to address this issue, but two challenges exist.
             First, an accurate description of OH- from AIMD needs an appropriate
             exchange-correlation functional. Second, a long trajectory is needed
             to reach an equilibrium state for the Ca2+-OH- and Mg2+-OH- ion pairs
             in aqueous solutions. Herein, we adopt a deep potential molecular
             dynamics (DPMD) method to simulate 1 ns trajectories for the Ca2+-OH-
             and Mg2+-OH- ion pairs in water; the DPMD method provides efficient
             machine-learning-based models that have the accuracy of the SCAN
             exchange-correlation functional within the framework of density
             functional theory. The solvation structures of the cations and the OH-
             in terms of three different species have been systematically
             investigated. On the one hand, we find that OH- have more significant
             effects on the solvation structure of Ca2+ than that of Mg2+. We
             observe that the OH- substantially affects the orientation angles of
             water molecules surrounding the cation. Through the time correlation
             functions, we conclude that the water molecules in the first solvation
             shell of Ca2+ change their preferred orientation faster than those of
             Mg2+. On the other hand, with the presence of the cation in the first
             solvation shell of OH-, we find that the hydrogen bonds of OH- are
             severely altered, and the adjacent water molecules of OH- are
             squeezed. The two cations have substantially different effects on the
             solvation structure of OH-. Our work provides new insight into the
             solvation structures of Ca2+ and Mg2+ in water with the presence of
             OH-.},

             processed fabrication. GBs exhibit complex atomistic structures
             undergoing slow rearrangements. By studying evolution of the
             {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}5(210) CsPbBr3 GB on a nanosecond time scale,
             comparable to charge carrier lifetimes, we demonstrate that GB
             deformations appear every {\ensuremath{\sim}}100 ps and increase
             significantly the probability of deep charge traps. However, the deep
             traps form only transiently for a few hundred femtoseconds. In
             contrast, shallow traps appear continuously at the GB. Shallow traps
             are localized in the GB layer, while deep traps are in a sublayer,
             which is still distorted from the pristine structure and can be jammed
             in unfavorable conformations. The GB electronic properties correlate
             with bond angles, with notable exception of the Br-Br distance, which
             provides a signature of halide migration along GBs. The transient
             nature of trap states and localization of electrons and holes at
             different parts of GBs indicate that charge carrier lifetimes should
             be long. At the same time, charge mobility can be reduced. The
             complex, multiscale evolution of geometric and electronic structures
             of GBs rationalize the contradictory statements made in the literature
